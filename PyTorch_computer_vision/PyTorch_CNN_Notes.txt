About the hyperparameters of the CNN

Padding : 
Used when the kernel extends beyond the activation map  
Helps preserve input spatial size
Zero - padding technique : replace borders by zeros 

Kernel size / filter size :
Dimensions of the sliding window over the input
Small kernel sizes > smaller reduction in layer dimensions > extract larger amount of information containing
    extract local features 
    deeper architecture
Large kernel size > extracts less information
    faster reduction in layer dimensions
    leading to worse performance
    better suited to extract features that are larger

Stride : 
Number of pixels that the kernel should be shifted over at a time
    Smaller stride > more features are learned because more data is extracted
